<h1>A Quick Puzzle to Test Your Problem Solving</h1>

<p>
  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.
</p>
<p>
  Here’s how it works:
</p>
We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
<p>
  We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<ul>
<% @list.each do |guess| %>
  <li>
    <%= guess.first_num %>,
    <%= guess.second_num %>,
    <%= guess.third_num %>
    <% if guess.first_num < guess.second_num && guess.second_num < guess.third_num %>
    Yes!
    <% else %>
    No.
    <% end %>
  </li>
<% end %>
</ul>

<p>Enter a sequence:</p>

<form action="/all_guesses">
  <label for="first">First number:</label>
  <input name="first_num" id="first" type="text" placeholder="The first number">

  <label for="second">Second number:</label>
  <input name="second_num" id="second" type="text" placeholder="The second number">

  <label for="third">Third number:</label>
  <input name="third_num" id="third" type="text" placeholder="The third number">
